	The banner cache contains a copy of the HTML code which is used to display the banner. By using a banner cache it is possible to speed
	up the delivery of banners because the HTML code doesn't need to be generated every time a banner is being delivered. Because the

	The zone cache is used to speed up delivery of banners which are linked to zones. The zone cache contains a copy of all the banners
	which are linked to the zone which saves a number of database queries when the banners are actually delivered to the user. The cache
