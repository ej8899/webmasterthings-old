Sympoll is a web-based voting package that requires PHP and MySQL.
Sympoll is written, designed, and maintained by David S. Raeman.  
ralusp@ralusp.net, http://www.ralusp.net

Administration authentication system was originally written by John 
Donagher (john@webmeta.com) and has been modified by Robert Brim 
(longwlkr@maxgaming.net) and David Raeman (ralusp@ralusp.net).  The 
original version has been very heavily modified and used here with 
permission.

| B - Install |
`------------*/

=STEP 0=
Be sure you have PHP3 or PHP4 (http://www.php.net) installed and working 
correctly.  Also, you must have access to a MySQL database 
(http://www.mysql.com) somewhere.  The database must already be created.
Sympoll will create the necessary tables within the database.


=STEP 1=
Make sure you have a MySQL user set up that will work with this script.
These are the minimum MySQL privileges needed:  
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, CREATE, DROP


=STEP 2=
Place the entire Sympoll directory somewhere in your web path. 
If you'd like to change the file extensions, you should do so now.
Sympoll will "auto-detect" the file extensions, so you can change them
to anything (for example .php3) without having to modify any of the
code.  The only requirement is that all PHP files in Sympoll must have 
the same extension.


=STEP 3=
Rename the "admin" directory to something else.  This is to prevent bad
people on the web from guessing which directory the administration stuff 
is in.  Be sure to just rename the directory itself, NOT the files within 
the directory.


=STEP 4=
Your config.php file must be writeable by your web server.  Certain
configurations, specifically some setups that use a CGI wrapper for PHP,
already have this functionality.  Otherwise, the easiest method is to
change the permissions on the file.  If you have shell access (telnet, ssh)
then you can log in, switch to the main sympoll directory, and type

  chmod 0666 ./config.php

Otherwise, check your FTP client for a way to change permissions.  Most
featureful clients support this.


=STEP 5=
Open up a web browser and go to the admin directory that you renamed in 
step 3.  Please note that in order for the PHP to parse properly, you must 
access it through HTTP, not as a local file.  If this is a new install, 
Sympoll will guide you through the process needed to set up your initial 
configuration file, your database tables, and your super admin logon.  It is 
important that you remember this login-- it is needed to modify your 
configuation and to create polls.


=STEP 6=
Setup is complete!  You now can log into the admin section with the username 
and password that you just created.  From here, you can create, delete, 
modify, and reset polls.


/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| C - Notes |
`----------*/

=NOTE 1=
After placing Sympoll in your web path, be sure to browse to the admin page
before leaving it alone.  The first time you visit the admin page you will
automatically be navigated through the setup.  It is not advisable to leave
this for other people to stumble upon and do.


=NOTE 2=
index.php is the only file included that is intended to be directly
linked to.  It is a list of all polls that are turned on, and allows
users to vote in any of them.  All other files will not work correctly
when linked to with an <A HREF> tag, and are used internally by Sympoll.


=NOTE 3=
When you are logged into the admin page, if somebody else logs in with the 
same admin name it will unauthenticate you and return you to the login screen.
Then, when you try to log back in, it will unauthenticate them.  If you 
anticipate multiple people may need to concurrently access the administration
page, you will need to create multiple admin accounts.  Only the super admin 
user (the first one created) will have access to add and remove other admin 
accounts.

| D - FAQ |
`--------*/

=FAQ 1=
Problem: I am installing Sympoll for the first time.  I enter my database
 information, but it gives me an error saying "unable to connect to 
 specified server."
Answer: This means that either the database username, database password,
 or database server is incorrect.  The specified database user must be
 able to connect to the specified database before the setup will continue.


=FAQ 2=
Problem: I am installing Sympoll for the first time.  I enter my database
 information, but it gives me an error saying "connected, but unable to
 access database."
Answer: This means that Sympoll was able to connect to the database server,
 but was not able to use the specified database.  The database either does
 not exist, or the specified user does not have access to use it.


=FAQ 3=
Problem: I am getting one of the following error messages:  "cannot 
 open config file for writing" or "cannot write config file"
Answer: Your web server is not able to write to the config.php file.
 See installation "STEP 4" above.


=FAQ 4=
Problem: I installed without any problems and created a poll.  I copied
 the code snippet directly as the admin section displayed it, but the
 booth isn't showing up in my page!  If I view the source for the page
 in my web browser, I can see the exact 2 lines of code that I copied.
Answer: This means that your web server isn't parsing the PHP correctly
 in that page.  This is usually because your web server only looks for
 PHP commands in files that end in certain extensions.  This depends on
 your web server configuration, but for PHP3 the file must usually end
 in ".php3" and for PHP4 the file must usually end in either ".php" or
 ".php3".  So, instead of putting the code in index.html you need to
 put it in index.php or something similar.  Most web servers that have
 PHP installed will let you use index.php or index.php3 as the 
 "default" web page. 


=FAQ 5=
Problem: My web server uses PHP3, not PHP4.  What should I do?
Answer: This script is entirely compatible with both PHP3 and PHP4.  
 You just need to rename _ALL_ of the included files so that they end
 in .php3 instead of .php.  See installation "STEP 2" above.


=FAQ 6=
Problem: Why is my poll giving the message "This poll has been disabled"
 instead of showing the voting booth?
Answer: The poll is disabled.  Go into the admin section, edit the poll
 and change its status


=FAQ 7=
Problem: Everything works fine except the image bars in the results are
 not showing up!  I used FTP to put them on my web page and I know that
 the file I am using is in Sympoll's images directory.
Answer: You probably uploaded the image(s) in ASCII mode instead of in BINARY
 mode in your FTP program.  Files that end in (.jpg .gif .png .zip .gz) all
 must be sent in BINARY mode (when using FTP) to work correctly.  This means
 the entire customize/bar_imgs directory!  


=FAQ 8=
Problem: For some reason, the included config.php is empty!
Answer: Yes, it is suppose to be empty when you first download Sympoll.
 It will get filled in during the setup process.


=FAQ 9=
Problem: Help!  I have a problem that isn't answered _ANYWHERE_ in this file!
Answer: No problem, you can either post a message on the Sympoll forum
 (which is linked on my web page) or email me.  I read that forum 
 frequently.  You can find my email address and web page address in 
 Part "A" of this file.

| E - Extra |
`----------*/

=EXTRA 1=
In addition to embedding a specific poll in a web page (instructions
will be provided after modifying a poll in the admin page), it is also
possible to display a RANDOM poll or to have it always display the LATEST
poll (show the poll with the most recent timestamp).  To do so, insert the 
appropriate code snippet from below.  Also, be sure that you always have 
at least one poll created and open (toggled ON) if you plan on using 
either of these:

  <?php require '/path/to/sympoll/booth.php';
  random_booth(); ?>

  <?php require '/path/to/sympoll/booth.php';
  newest_booth(); ?>

Neither function will select a disabled or closed booth.  Also, please
note that having more than one random poll on the same page is not currently
supported and might not function properly.  Mixing one random poll with any
number of non-random polls is okay AS LONG AS the random poll comes first.


=EXTRA 2=
By default, Sympoll directly prints the booth/results using PHP's echo.
If you'd rather have Sympoll RETURN a string and echo nothing directly
(for use in a template or something similar), see the comments at the very 
end of the booth.php file.  If you aren't sure what this is talking about,
then don't worry about it.  =)


=EXTRA 3=
If your website uses a language not included with Sympoll, you will want to
edit customize/language/custom.php.  Replace the English words with their
equivalent in your language.  Only change lines that begin with a dollar
sign ($) and only change the value between the quotes (").  Next, log into
the administration page, choose miscellany options, and set the language 
to "<custom>".  You should not need to make any other modifications to the
script to use a different language.  If you would like your language included
in a future version of Sympoll, please email me a copy of your modified
custom.php file.  Please make sure the translations are accurate and remember
to tell me what the language is!  My email address can be found in "PART A"
of this file.


=EXTRA 4=
If you'd like to customize the poll list page ("More Polls"), you will want
to edit the customize/polllist/header.php and customize/polllist/footer.php
files.  The stuff in the header.php file is included before the list of
polls, and the stuff in the footer.php file is included after the list of
polls.  If you'd like to change the colors used in the poll list, you will
want to edit the <BODY> tag in the customize/polllist/header.php file.


=EXTRA 5=
Using SHTML for your web page instead of PHP?  Not a problem, here's an easy
way to incorporate Sympoll into SHTML.  When the admin section gives you the
snippet of PHP code, put that snippet in its own .php (or .php3) file.  Then
in your .shtml file, just use a server-side include on the small .php file 
that you just created. For example: <!--#include virtual="/sympoll/p1.php"-->

If you get a message saying [an error occurred while processing this directive]
there are a couple of things that could cause this error.  First, make sure
that the path is correct.  If you are using a virtual include, the path should
be the same as the path to the file in your web URL, not file system path.
Second, make sure that the file exists and is readable.  If you take the path
you used in the virtual include, add it to the end of your web page hostname
and try to go to that address in your web browser, does it work?  If not, then
you may want to check the above possibilities again.  Otherwise, your web
hosting server probably does not allow you to ssi php files, even if ssi of
other files is permitted.  Under apache, this is the case if the
"IncludesNOEXEC" value is used in the "Options" directive.  You can try to
override this by placing a file named .htaccess (with the period) in your main
web directory and putting the line "Options Includes" in it without the quotes.
If that doesn't work, contact your web host support and ask them whether they
have blocked exec includes.  For more information about the "Options" directive
used in apache, see  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#options
