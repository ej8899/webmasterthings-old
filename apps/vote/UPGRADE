FOR USERS OF SYMPOLL 0.2.0 AND ABOVE:

An upgrade detection script is built into the admin interface.  Upon
going to the admin login page after upgrading your Sympoll files, a
message will appear if any database upgrades are needed.  If no message
appears, then the database structure has not changed from your version
and nothing else needs to be done.  Versions of Sympoll earlier than
0.2.0 cannot be upgraded correctly.  If you happen to be running a
version older than 0.2.0, you will have to start over with a clean install.
Also, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT VERSION OF SYMPOLL YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM!

WARNING: If you are upgrading from 0.2.3 or earlier, then all of your admin
logon names will be reset.  Sorry, there is no way around this.  No poll data
should be lost.

In order for an upgrade to succeed, your MySQL user must have these privileges
for the Sympoll database: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, CREATE, DROP


**************
* TO UPGRADE *
**************

First it is important that you delete all of your old Sympoll files and then
unpackage all of the new files.  Do not mix files between different versions.
Furthermore, make sure you are logged out of your old administration page
(actually select the logout option, don't just close your browser) before
upgrading.

Go to the URL of your admin directory.  Sympoll should detect that an upgrade
is needed.  It will prompt you for the version of Sympoll that you are
upgrading from.  BE SURE TO SELECT THE CORRECT VERSION!  

A success message will appear once the upgrade is complete.  If there are any
problems, the script will print a failure message and will stop.

That's it!
